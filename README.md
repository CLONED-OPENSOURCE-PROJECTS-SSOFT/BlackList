Blacklist is a free Android application that allows you to conveniently configure the blocking
of unwanted calls and SMS, has light and dark UI themes and works on Android devices since 2.3.

Because of the security policy in Android 6.0 and later versions, the application requires rights:
1) Named: "Access photos, media and files". Allows reading and writing the files in the internal
memory of the device - for storing the block lists.
2) Named: "Send and view SMS messages". Allows to display and block incoming SMS messages.
3) Named: "Make and manage phone calls". Allows to block incoming calls.
4) Named: "Access contacts". Allows to display a list of contacts.

Because of the security policy in Android 4.4 and later versions to block the incoming SMS messages
it is required to give to the application the rights of "Default SMS-application" in the Settings.
If necessary, you can always disable this option and return to the previous "Default
SMS-application". In this case, the SMS blocking will be disabled. At the moment the application
supports the functions of blocking and exchanging SMS messages only. Support for MMS messages has
not yet been implemented.

Features:

1) Messaging
This is a list of records with info about the events of calls/SMS blocking. Disabling logging of
the events can be done in the Settings.

2) Blacklist
This is a list of contacts with numbers, calls and SMS from which you plan to block. Add a contact
to the list by clicking the \"+\" toolbar button and from the resulting menu choose one of the
suggested ways to add a contact. If you manually add a blocked contact, you can choose one of the
rules for comparing numbers: \"equals\", \"contains\", \"starts with\", or \"ends with\". To edit,
delete, or move a contact to another list, make a long click on its line. If you want to
temporarily disable blocking contacts from the Blacklist, you can do this in the Settings.

3) Whitelist
This is a list of contacts with numbers, calls and SMS from which you do not plan to block. This
list is useful for additional setting of exceptions from blocking. It has a higher priority than
other lists when resolving conflicts between them.
Attention! If in the Settings is set the blocking of all incoming calls or SMS, then even those
calls/SMS, whose numbers are included in the Whitelist, will be blocked. Management the contacts
in the Whitelist is similar to the Blacklist.

4) Event list
This is a list of records with info about the events of calls/SMS blocking. Disabling logging of
the events can be done in the Settings.

5) Settings
In the Settings you can set the blocking of all calls and SMS from numbers that are not in the
list of contacts of your phone and (or) not included in the list of phone numbers with which you
exchanged SMS. These options can be used in conjunction with the Black and White lists, or
separately. You can adjust the level of visual and audio information about the event of blocking.
You can set the light or dark theme of the application interface. Here, you can also export and
import application data, for example, to transfer them from one device to another.
